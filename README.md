Simple Linear regression in Python.
You get sample data, come up with a model that explains the data, and then make predictions for the whole population based on the model youâ€™ve developed.

There is a dependent variable, labeled Y, being predicted, and independent variables, labeled x1, x2, and so forth. These are the predictors. Y is a function of the X variables, and the regression model is a linear approximation of this function.

The easiest regression model is the simple linear regression.
